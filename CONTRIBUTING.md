## Code Contributions

The SpearIT Project Framework is currently maintained by SpearIT, LLC.

**At this time, we are not actively soliciting code contributions** as the project is in its early release phase and we're focused on stabilizing based on user feedback.

If you'd like to propose a code change:
1. **Open an issue first** to discuss the approach and rationale
2. **Wait for maintainer feedback** before investing time in implementation
3. This helps ensure your effort aligns with the project's direction

We may expand contribution guidelines as the project matures and community needs become clearer.
