## Upgrading from Light Edition

**Can both plugins coexist?** Yes! Different namespaces prevent conflicts:
- Light edition: `/spearit-framework-light:*`
- Comprehensive edition: `/spearit-framework:*`

**When to upgrade:**
- You need session history tracking
- You want AI-guided roadmap planning
- You're ready for the complete feature set
