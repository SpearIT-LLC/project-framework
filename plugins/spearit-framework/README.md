# SpearIT Project Framework - Full Edition Plugin

**Status:** Planned (not yet implemented)

This directory will contain the full framework plugin with all commands and features.

## Preserved Files from Light Edition

The following files were removed from the light edition MVP and preserved here for the full plugin:

- **commands/session-history.md** - Session history documentation command
- **templates/session-history-template.md** - Session history template

**Date preserved:** 2026-02-12 (TASK-126 scope reduction)

## Future Development

The full framework plugin will include:
- All commands from light edition (help, new, move)
- Session history documentation (session-history)
- Project status summary (status)
- Work in progress tracking (wip)
- Backlog review and prioritization (backlog)
- Framework reference (topic-index)
- AI-guided roadmap creation (roadmap)

See FEAT-118 for historical context.
