## Scope Boundaries

### In Scope

**Phase 1 (MVP):**
- [What we're building in first release]
- [Core functionality included]

**Future Phases:**
- [What we plan to add later]
- [Enhancements roadmapped]

### Out of Scope

**Explicitly NOT building:**
- [Feature/capability 1 we're NOT doing] - [Reason why not]
- [Feature/capability 2 we're NOT doing] - [Reason why not]
- [Edge case we're not handling] - [Reason why not]

**Why these are out of scope:**
- [Explanation of rationale for exclusions]

### Scope Decision Framework

**When deciding if something is in scope, ask:**
1. Does it serve the primary users?
2. Does it support a core use case?
3. Does it align with success criteria?
4. Can we deliver it with available resources?

**If yes to all four:** Consider adding to scope
**If no to any:** Defer or exclude
