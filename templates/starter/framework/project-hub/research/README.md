## Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

ADRs document significant architectural decisions and their context.

**When to create an ADR:**
- Choosing between multiple approaches
- Making decisions that affect system architecture
- Decisions that future developers will need context for

**Templates:** `framework/templates/decisions/`
