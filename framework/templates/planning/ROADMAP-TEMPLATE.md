# [Project Name] - Roadmap

**Last Updated:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Next Review:** YYYY-MM-DD (Quarterly recommended)

## Purpose

This roadmap defines the strategic direction for [Project Name]. It organizes work into stable **themes** (project categories) and temporal **planning periods** (time-bound goals).

**Key Concepts:**
- **Themes** = Stable categories of work (what the project IS)
- **Planning Periods** = Time-bound focus areas (what you're working on NOW)

**Roadmap vs Backlog:**
- **Roadmap** = Strategic direction (themes, planning periods, goals)
- **Backlog** = Tactical work items (specific features/bugs supporting themes)

---

## Project Themes

### 1. [Theme Name]
[1-2 sentence description of what this theme encompasses and why it matters]

### 2. [Theme Name]

## How to Use This Roadmap

**For Project Members:**
1. **Themes** help categorize work - every work item should map to a theme
2. **Planning Periods** show current focus - not all themes are active simultaneously
3. Review roadmap at planning period boundaries, adjust based on learnings
4. Themes are stable; planning periods evolve

**For Stakeholders:**
1. Understand project direction without diving into backlog details
2. See progress through completed planning periods
3. Provide feedback on theme priorities and planning period goals

**For AI Assistants:**
1. Use themes for context when prioritizing or creating work items
2. Reference current planning period when answering "what should we work on?"
3. Planning periods provide strategic framing for technical decisions
4. Suggest work items connect to themes via metadata

**Relationship: Themes ↔ Planning Periods ↔ Work Items:**
- **Themes** = Stable project categories (e.g., "Workflow", "Distribution")
- **Planning Periods** = Temporal goals focusing on 1-2 themes
- **Work Items** = Tactical tasks supporting themes, optionally tagged with planning period

---

**Note:** This roadmap is a guide, not a commitment. Planning periods may shift based on feedback, discoveries, or changing requirements. The roadmap informs decisions; it doesn't constrain them.
