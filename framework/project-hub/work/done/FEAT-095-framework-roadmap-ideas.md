# Framework Roadmap Ideas

**Status:** Done (Supporting document for FEAT-095)
**Completed:** 2026-02-04

## Abstract
This document is a sketch pad of ideas I have about the framework roadmap. It is meant to provide another perspective for FEAT-095.

## Broad Categories
These categories could enhance or replace existing categories for the framework project.

- Workflow
  - How tickets move through the system.
  - (Should Release be included here or does it deserve it's own category?)
- Release
  - Process to release
  - Distribution
- Project Planning.
  - Roadmaps
  - Research
  - Feasibility
  - Reporting
  - Phases
- Project Implementation
  - Methods
    - Templates
  - Milestones
    - Definition
    - Identifying
- Coding
  - Standards
  - Testing
  - Security
  - Methods
    - Templates
- Optimizations
  - Performance improvements
  - Efficency improvements

## AI Questions
- What are some generic categories that apply to all, or most projects?
- What are typical roadmap categories or steps across the industry?
- Are there some patterns typical for each "type" of project?
- Should a roadmap be organized by Themes or Features?

## Framework Features
A broad overview of the major features of the framework. 
Is this accurate? Can we summarize the framework down to just 3 main features? Am I missing anything?

I've included SOME of the work items related to the bullet points for reference. We should probably associate all open tickets under this feature outline.

### User Features
- Workflow
  - Kanban
  - Release
  - Distribution
  - Workflow patterns
- Project Guidance
  - Setup tech-081, feat-006
    - There's some important user experience issues here. First useage must be positive.
  - Project definition feat-087, 
  - Project organization feat-089
    - Project patterns
    - Define pattern based on project type
  - Reporting feat-015
  - Roadmaps feat-095, feat-091
  - Planning Periods feat-092, feat-093
  - Research (project level)
  - Retrospectives
- Developer Guidance
  - Coding standards
  - Development methods
    - Developer patterns e.g Research, POC, MVP, Code, Test, Refactor, Test, Secure, Test
    - Robust verses "quick"
    - Define pattern based on impact?
  - Testing
  - Security
  - POC
  - Research (code level)
  - Bringing order to a preexisting messy code base (the scenario: user has an existing code base, then discovers the framework. How does the framework identify and help to bring order? /fw-code-review?) This might be more of an advance feature.
- Distribution & Onboarding
  - Security concerns
    - We're only delivering a zip file but how do we assure it's secure?
  - Does the initial setup activity belong here instead of project guidance? There's some overlap but it starts here.
  - 

### Technical Features
Not sure this is worth separating.

- AI Collaboration
  - Although this IS a major feature, it's integrated into everything else so does it really deserve it's own category? It's definitely worth mentioning in overview or marketing material but it's not really something that stands on it's own apart from the other features. AI Collaboration hovers over the entire framework.

  - Hooks
  - Roles
  - AI Model selection
- Project structure
- Documentation
