./framework/thoughts/history/releases/v3.0.0/FEAT-026-VALIDATION-REPORT.md:- **Better:** Intuitive monorepo structure
./framework/thoughts/history/releases/v3.0.0/RELEASE-NOTES.md:This release represents a fundamental restructuring of the project-framework repository into a monorepo architecture. The framework content has been moved into a dedicated `framework/` folder, and a reference implementation (`project-hello-world/`) has been created. The framework now fully dogfoods itself using the Standard Project Structure.
./framework/thoughts/history/sessions/2026-01-04-SESSION-HISTORY.md:- Option A: Single monorepo
./framework/thoughts/history/sessions/2026-01-04-SESSION-HISTORY.md:- **Multi-repo complexity:** Resolved with monorepo development strategy
./framework/thoughts/history/sessions/2026-01-05-SESSION-HISTORY.md:**Repository ≠ Project in monorepo model**
./framework/thoughts/history/sessions/2026-01-06-SESSION-HISTORY.md:- Update README.md for new monorepo structure
./framework/thoughts/history/sessions/2026-01-06-SESSION-HISTORY.md:- Created missing `/CLAUDE.md` for monorepo navigation
./framework/thoughts/history/sessions/2026-01-07-SESSION-HISTORY.md:- REPOSITORY-STRUCTURE.md - Repository root structure (monorepo)
./framework/thoughts/history/sessions/2026-01-10-SESSION-HISTORY.md:- Written before FEAT-026 restructured repository into monorepo
./framework/thoughts/history/sessions/2026-01-10-SESSION-HISTORY.md:- 9 READMEs total across monorepo
./framework/thoughts/history/sessions/2026-01-11-SESSION-HISTORY.md:- N/A .gitignore - Correctly at repository root (monorepo pattern)
./framework/thoughts/history/sessions/2026-01-11-SESSION-HISTORY.md:Identified dogfooding issue where FEAT-039 (project-hello-world validation) was tracked in framework/thoughts/work/ instead of project-hello-world/thoughts/work/. Led to productive discussion about monorepo context switching and extension to FEAT-037 (Project Config File) to address the problem.
./framework/thoughts/history/sessions/2026-01-11-SESSION-HISTORY.md:**Core Question:** How do AI and user communicate which project context we're working in within the monorepo?
./framework/thoughts/history/sessions/2026-01-11-SESSION-HISTORY.md:**Interim Solution:** Updated monorepo CLAUDE.md with explicit guidance
./framework/thoughts/history/sessions/2026-01-11-SESSION-HISTORY.md:**Files Modified:** `CLAUDE.md` (monorepo root)
./framework/thoughts/history/sessions/2026-01-11-SESSION-HISTORY.md:- Finalize monorepo config structure
./framework/thoughts/history/sessions/2026-01-11-SESSION-HISTORY.md:- Per-project configs cleaner than monorepo root config
./framework/thoughts/history/sessions/2026-01-11-SESSION-HISTORY.md:Identified important dogfooding gap in monorepo workflow. Extended FEAT-037 with monorepo context switching requirements. Updated monorepo CLAUDE.md with interim guidance establishing framework as default project and explicit context switching protocol. Design discussion captured for future implementation.
./framework/thoughts/history/sessions/2026-01-12-SESSION-HISTORY.md:- Discussed for monorepo vs standalone projects
./framework/thoughts/history/sessions/2026-01-12-SESSION-HISTORY.md:- Realized: Projects using the framework ARE in monorepo, not standalone
./framework/thoughts/history/sessions/2026-01-12-SESSION-HISTORY.md:**Key clarification:** If someone uses this framework, they work IN the monorepo structure. The framework IS the project structure.
./framework/thoughts/history/sessions/2026-01-12-SESSION-HISTORY.md:- Impact analysis on current monorepo
./framework/thoughts/history/sessions/2026-01-13-SESSION-HISTORY.md:**Decision:** Adopt "framework source repository" terminology instead of "monorepo"
./framework/thoughts/history/sessions/2026-01-13-SESSION-HISTORY.md:- Not a monorepo in traditional sense (multiple independent projects)
./framework/thoughts/history/sessions/2026-01-13-SESSION-HISTORY.md:- Update terminology throughout (monorepo → framework source repository)
./framework/thoughts/history/sessions/2026-01-13-SESSION-HISTORY.md:- "monorepo" → "framework source repository"
./framework/thoughts/history/sessions/2026-01-13-SESSION-HISTORY.md:### Q: "Are we still a monorepo after this change?"
./framework/thoughts/history/sessions/2026-01-13-SESSION-HISTORY.md:**A:** No. Framework-as-dependency model means we're a "framework source repository" with examples, not a traditional monorepo with peer projects.
./framework/thoughts/history/sessions/2026-01-13-SESSION-HISTORY.md:- Discussion about monorepo terminology led to deeper insights
./framework/thoughts/research/package-ecosystem-terminology-patterns.md:| "monorepo" | "framework source repository" | Repository type |
./framework/thoughts/research/package-ecosystem-terminology-patterns.md:3. ✅ **Terminology:** Use "framework source repository" instead of "monorepo"
./framework/thoughts/work/backlog/DECISION-035-root-status-reference.md:Decide whether the root README.md should reference framework/PROJECT-STATUS.md or have its own root-level status document for the monorepo.
./framework/thoughts/work/backlog/DECISION-035-root-status-reference.md:- This treats framework/ as the "main" project in the monorepo
./framework/thoughts/work/backlog/DECISION-035-root-status-reference.md:- Should monorepo have its own status document?
./framework/thoughts/work/backlog/DECISION-035-root-status-reference.md:- Should we distinguish monorepo status from framework status?
./framework/thoughts/work/backlog/DECISION-035-root-status-reference.md:- Framework status represents monorepo status
./framework/thoughts/work/backlog/DECISION-035-root-status-reference.md:- No distinction needed between monorepo and framework
./framework/thoughts/work/backlog/DECISION-035-root-status-reference.md:- Framework status represents monorepo status
./framework/thoughts/work/backlog/DECISION-035-root-status-reference.md:- ❌ Could be confusing in true multi-project monorepo
./framework/thoughts/work/backlog/DECISION-035-root-status-reference.md:- ❌ Doesn't distinguish monorepo from project
./framework/thoughts/work/backlog/DECISION-035-root-status-reference.md:**Approach:** Create PROJECT-STATUS.md at root for monorepo status
./framework/thoughts/work/backlog/DECISION-035-root-status-reference.md:- Overall monorepo status

./framework/thoughts/work/backlog/DECISION-035-root-status-reference.md:- ✅ Room for monorepo-level information
./framework/thoughts/work/backlog/DECISION-035-root-status-reference.md:**Approach:** Create MONOREPO-STATUS.md at root for monorepo-specific info
./framework/thoughts/work/backlog/DECISION-035-root-status-reference.md:- ✅ Explicit about monorepo structure
./framework/thoughts/work/backlog/DECISION-035-root-status-reference.md:   - Explain monorepo structure? (secondary)
./framework/thoughts/work/backlog/DECISION-035-root-status-reference.md:3. **Is monorepo status different from framework status?**
./framework/thoughts/work/backlog/DECISION-035-root-status-reference.md:   - Maybe monorepo structure decisions
./framework/thoughts/work/backlog/DECISION-035-root-status-reference.md:- Framework IS the main project in this monorepo
./framework/thoughts/work/backlog/DECISION-035-root-status-reference.md:- Framework status accurately represents monorepo status
./framework/thoughts/work/backlog/DECISION-035-root-status-reference.md:3. Is monorepo information distinct from framework info? (no → Option 1)
./framework/thoughts/work/backlog/DECISION-035-root-status-reference.md:- [ ] Document monorepo structure
./framework/thoughts/work/backlog/DECISION-035-root-status-reference.md:- If monorepo tracking becomes distinct from framework
./framework/thoughts/work/backlog/DECISION-036-template-access-strategy.md:- Users reference `../framework/templates/` (if monorepo) or keep separate framework reference
./framework/thoughts/work/backlog/DECISION-036-template-access-strategy.md:- ❌ Monorepo assumption - Works best in monorepo structure
./framework/thoughts/work/backlog/DECISION-036-template-access-strategy.md:- Users maintain framework reference copy separately (if not monorepo)
./framework/thoughts/work/backlog/DECISION-036-template-access-strategy.md:- ✅ Works for any project type - Not monorepo-dependent
./framework/thoughts/work/backlog/DECISION-036-template-access-strategy.md:- Consider that most users will likely be creating single-project repositories (not monorepos)
./framework/thoughts/work/backlog/DECISION-050-framework-distribution-model.md:**Problem:** How should user projects relate to the framework? Should they reference a shared framework (monorepo), or should each project have its own framework copy (framework-as-dependency)?
./framework/thoughts/work/backlog/DECISION-050-framework-distribution-model.md:monorepo/
./framework/thoughts/work/backlog/DECISION-050-framework-distribution-model.md:- ❌ Not portable - Must maintain monorepo structure
./framework/thoughts/work/backlog/DECISION-050-framework-distribution-model.md:If we adopt **Option 1 (Framework-as-Dependency)**, the current monorepo structure changes:
./framework/thoughts/work/backlog/DECISION-050-framework-distribution-model.md:Should we immediately refactor this monorepo to use the new model?
./framework/thoughts/work/backlog/DECISION-050-framework-distribution-model.md:**This is a paradigm shift** from "shared framework in monorepo" to "framework as dependency for each project."

./framework/thoughts/work/done/FEAT-039-verify-hello-world-compliance.md:project-hello-world/ was created as part of FEAT-026 monorepo restructuring to serve as a reference implementation of the Standard Framework. However, we need to verify:
./framework/thoughts/work/todo/FEAT-025-ALIGNMENT-ANALYSIS.md:The work item was written before FEAT-026 restructured the repository into a monorepo with framework/ and project-hello-world/ folders, and established definitive structure standards. Many references, paths, and structural assumptions in FEAT-025 are now outdated or incorrect.
./framework/thoughts/work/todo/FEAT-025-ALIGNMENT-ANALYSIS.md:- Repository is now a monorepo with minimal root (README, QUICK-START, CLAUDE, LICENSE, .gitignore)
./framework/thoughts/work/todo/FEAT-025-ALIGNMENT-ANALYSIS.md:- User projects reference `../framework/templates/` (if in monorepo)

./framework/thoughts/work/todo/FEAT-037-project-config-file.md:**Context:** While working on FEAT-039 (validating project-hello-world), we discovered a practical issue: how do AI and user communicate which project context we're working in within the monorepo?
./framework/thoughts/work/todo/FEAT-037-project-config-file.md:   - Option A: Per-project configs only, CLAUDE.md handles monorepo navigation
./framework/thoughts/work/todo/FEAT-037-project-config-file.md:   - **Leaning toward Option A** - CLAUDE.md already serves monorepo navigation purpose
./framework/thoughts/work/todo/FEAT-037-project-config-file.md:2. **Config location decision conflict:** Line 412 says "Project root" but in monorepo context, which root?
./framework/thoughts/work/todo/FEAT-037-project-config-file.md:   - **Need to clarify:** "project root" = each project's root, not monorepo root
