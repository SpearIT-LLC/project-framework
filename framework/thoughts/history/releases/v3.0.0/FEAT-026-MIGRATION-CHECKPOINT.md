## Collision Analysis

✅ **NO COLLISIONS** - All pre-migration checks passed (see FEAT-026-collision-analysis.md)

---

## Git Commits So Far

1. `a214341` - chore: Move FEAT-026 to doing/ and add collision analysis
2. `c824265` - feat(FEAT-026): Phase 1 - Create target folder structure
3. `72a51ff` - feat(FEAT-026): Phase 2 - Move framework content to framework/
4. `45c9b86` - feat(FEAT-026): Phase 3 - Move framework project tracking
5. `69fd5c1` - feat(FEAT-026): Phase 4 - Move root documentation to framework/

---

## Statistics

**Total files moved so far:** 102 files
**Git history preserved:** 100% (all moves via `git mv`)
**Phases completed:** 4 of 7 (57%)
**Estimated remaining work:** 3 phases (create hello-world, cleanup, validate)

---

## Next Steps for New Session

1. **Resume context:** Read this checkpoint file
2. **Verify state:** Check branch is feature/feat-026-structure-migration-v3
3. **Continue Phase 5:** Create hello-world project files
4. **Execute Phase 6:** Cleanup and update references
5. **Execute Phase 7:** Final validation
6. **Commit and merge:** After validation passes

---

## Important Notes

- All moves used `git mv` to preserve git history
- Structure successfully flattened from 4 levels to 3 levels
- No collisions encountered during migration
- Current work items (FEAT-026) are in framework/thoughts/work/doing/
- Migration is on dedicated feature branch (safe to iterate)

## Files That Need Content Updates (Phase 6)

### Root Level
- `README.md` - Update for monorepo structure (framework/ + project-hello-world/)
- `QUICK-START.md` - Update paths and getting started guide

### Framework Level
- `framework/CLAUDE.md` - Update paths (thoughts/project → framework/thoughts)
- `framework/INDEX.md` - Update paths
- `framework/PROJECT-STATUS.md` - Update paths and status

### All Markdown Files
- Search and replace: `thoughts/project/collaboration/` → `framework/collaboration/`
- Search and replace: `thoughts/framework/templates/` → `framework/templates/`
- Search and replace: `thoughts/project/planning/backlog/` → `framework/thoughts/work/backlog/`
- Update any other path references
