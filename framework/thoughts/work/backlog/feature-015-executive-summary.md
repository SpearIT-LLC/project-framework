# Feature: Executive Summary Reporting

**ID:** FEAT-015
**Type:** Feature
**Priority:** Low
**Version Impact:** MINOR
**Created:** 2025-12-19

---

## Summary

Generate executive-level status reports from project framework data, producing concise A4-formatted documents suitable for stakeholder presentations and executive briefings.

---

## Problem Statement

**What problem does this solve?**

PROJECT-STATUS.md and CHANGELOG.md contain detailed information for developers, but executives and stakeholders need:
- High-level status at a glance
- Key metrics and milestones
- Risk indicators and blockers
- Progress visualization
- Professional formatting for presentations

Manual creation of executive summaries is time-consuming and prone to being out-of-date.

**Who is affected?**

- Project managers presenting to executives
- Solo developers reporting to clients/stakeholders
- Team leads providing status updates to leadership
- Organizations requiring formal status reporting

**Current workaround:**

Manual extraction of key points from PROJECT-STATUS.md and CHANGELOG.md, then formatting in Word/Google Docs.

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Data Collection
1. Parse PROJECT-STATUS.md for current version, status, metrics
2. Parse CHANGELOG.md for recent changes (last 30 days by default)
3. Scan work/ folders and count items in each stage
4. Identify BLOCKER items for risks section
5. Extract milestone targets from roadmap.md

### Phase 2: Report Generation
1. Load report template (customizable per project)
2. Populate template with collected data
3. Generate executive summary using key points
4. Create progress bars/charts using ASCII art
5. Format as Markdown

### Phase 3: Output
1. Write Markdown to file: `reports/executive-summary-YYYY-MM-DD.md`
2. Optional: Convert to PDF using Pandoc
3. Optional: Generate comparison to previous report

### Template Variables

```markdown
{{PROJECT_NAME}}
{{REPORTING_PERIOD_START}}
{{REPORTING_PERIOD_END}}
{{CURRENT_VERSION}}
{{OVERALL_STATUS}}  # On Track | At Risk | Blocked
{{EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY}}  # Auto-generated
{{COMPLETION_PERCENTAGE}}
{{ACTIVE_WORK_ITEMS}}
{{BLOCKERS_COUNT}}
{{RECENT_ACCOMPLISHMENTS}}  # From CHANGELOG
{{MILESTONE_TIMELINE}}  # ASCII progress bars
{{RISKS_AND_BLOCKERS}}  # From BLOCKER work items
{{NEXT_PRIORITIES}}  # From work/todo/
```
