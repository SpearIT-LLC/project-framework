# SpearIT Project Framework - Roadmap

**Last Updated:** 2026-02-01
**Next Review:** 2026-05-01 (Quarterly recommended)

---

## Purpose

The SpearIT Project Framework is a "batteries-included" collaborative development framework that brings professional project management practices to solo and small team development.

**The Problem:**
Solo and small team projects often drift into "vibe mode"—loose direction, unclear scope, and inconsistent practices. AI collaboration degrades as context is lost and focus drifts across sprawling tasks. Developers get buried in tactical implementation details while losing sight of strategic goals. Every new project brings the same setup tax: reinventing structure, debating process choices, and configuring the same scaffolding over and over.

**The Solution:**
The framework provides a ready-to-use kanban workflow with professional practices built-in—no external tooling or licensing required. Through role-based AI collaboration, the framework elevates strategic thinking and maintains project clarity. Consistent, battle-tested patterns let teams start building immediately instead of reinventing process.

**The Transformation:**
From "vibe mode" to professional discipline. From reinventing process to "insert and go." From AI context drift to focused, structured collaboration. From setup tax to immediate productivity.

**Roadmap vs Backlog:**
- **Roadmap** = Strategic direction (6-12 month horizon, themes and milestones)
- **Backlog** = Tactical work items (specific features/bugs supporting themes)

## Current Focus (Q1-Q2 2026)

### Theme 1: Project Guidance & Planning (PRIMARY FOCUS)

**Goal:** Build AI-guided project planning capabilities that help developers create and execute professional project plans—regardless of their PM experience. Create planning patterns for application projects that guide users through strategic thinking like a senior project manager would.

**Status:** 🚧 In Progress

**Key Milestones:**
- 🚧 Define pattern MVP for application projects (FEAT-089)
- 🚧 Implement AI-guided roadmap creation (FEAT-095)
- 📋 Validate pattern with hello world application project
- 📋 Complete end-to-end planning workflow (idea → roadmap → work items)

**Success Metrics:**
- **Application project pattern MVP complete:** MVP defined with clear milestones, AI guidance implemented (fw-roadmap + implementation planning), validated with hello world application project
- **User can successfully plan an application project:** Observable outcome where user starts with idea → AI guides through planning → User has actionable roadmap with themes, milestones, and initial work items. Validated with at least one test project planned end-to-end.

**What's Next:**
- Complete FEAT-089 first task: Define pattern MVP scope and milestones
- Finish FEAT-095: fw-roadmap skill implementation
- Validate MVP pattern with hello world application
- Expand to other project types (framework, library, toolbox) after application pattern proven

### Theme 2: Framework Adoption & Onboarding (SECONDARY FOCUS)

**Goal:** Reduce friction and create a smooth first-time experience for new framework users. Make it easy for developers to adopt the framework and start their first project with minimal confusion or support needed.

**Status:** 📋 Planned

**Key Milestones:**
- 📋 Create streamlined onboarding documentation
- 📋 Implement setup automation/scripts
- 📋 Validate <10 minute experience (download → first work item)

**Success Metrics:**
- **Onboarding path complete, documented, and validated:** Complete flow from download → setup → first project → first work item. Documented in quick-start guide. Validated that new users can go from download to productive use in <10 minutes.

**What's Next:**
- Document ideal onboarding flow (framework purpose → download → setup → first work item)
- Create/improve setup automation
- Test with new user to validate experience

---

## Next Phase (Q3 2026)

_To be determined based on Q1-Q2 learnings and Theme 1/2 completion_

---

## Future Considerations

### Development Process Patterns
**Status:** Deferred until Project Guidance & Planning is functional

- Guide developers through proven development workflows (research → POC → MVP → test → security)
- Process patterns, not language-specific syntax
- Related work item: FEAT-090

### Workflow Maturity
**Status:** Maintenance mode - address critical issues only

- Polish kanban workflow based on user feedback
- Eliminate friction points for new users
- No major new features planned; focus is on stability

---

## Deferred / On Hold

### Development Process Patterns (FEAT-090)
**Why deferred:** Waiting for Project Guidance & Planning theme to reach functional state. Pattern-based development guidance is valuable but secondary to core planning capabilities.

---

## Completed Milestones

_No completed milestones yet - this is the initial roadmap._

---

## Theme Definitions

### Project Guidance & Planning
AI-guided planning tools and patterns that help developers create professional project plans, break down work strategically, and track progress—without requiring formal PM training. Focuses on making strategic thinking accessible through role-based AI collaboration.

### Framework Adoption & Onboarding
Reducing friction in the first-time framework experience. Covers quick-start documentation, setup automation, and streamlined workflows that get new users from "What is this?" to productive work in under 10 minutes.

## How to Use This Roadmap

**For Team Members:**
1. When prioritizing backlog items, consider which theme they support
2. Review roadmap quarterly, adjust themes based on learnings
3. Themes inform decisions ("Does this align with our current focus?")

**For Stakeholders:**
1. Understand project direction without diving into backlog details
2. See progress toward strategic goals
3. Provide feedback on theme priorities

**For AI Assistants:**
1. Use themes for context when prioritizing work items
2. Reference roadmap when answering "what should we work on?"
3. Roadmap provides strategic framing for technical decisions

---

**Note:** This roadmap is a guide, not a commitment. Themes and priorities may shift based on user feedback, technical discoveries, or changing requirements. The roadmap informs decisions; it doesn't constrain them.
