# External References

This folder contains **authoritative external references** for offline/quick access.

**Purpose:** Convenience cache of fact-based, authoritative sources.

**Deletion Test:** If this folder is deleted, we lose convenience but NOT project understanding. All content should be re-findable from authoritative sources.

**Store here:**
- ✅ RFC specifications
- ✅ Official API documentation (versioned snapshots)
- ✅ Industry standards (ISO, IEEE, W3C)
- ✅ Language specifications (ECMAScript, Python PEP)
- ✅ Authoritative cheat sheets

**Do NOT store here:**
- ❌ Blog posts or opinion pieces → Use `research/` if analyzing
- ❌ Our analysis or investigations → Use `research/`
- ❌ Competitive analysis → Use `research/`
- ❌ Tutorial articles → Bookmark externally

**Rule:** Only authoritative, replaceable, fact-based references.

See also: [research/README.md](../research/README.md) for distinction.
