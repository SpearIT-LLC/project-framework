# Research

This folder contains **project-specific research and decisions**.

**Purpose:** Document investigations, analysis, and architectural decisions for THIS project.

**Deletion Test:** If this folder is deleted, we lose critical project intellectual property and decision rationale. This content is IRREPLACEABLE.

**Store here:**
- ✅ Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
- ✅ Technology evaluations (Stripe vs PayPal)
- ✅ Competitive analysis
- ✅ Feature feasibility studies
- ✅ Third-party integration investigations
- ✅ Performance benchmarking results
- ✅ Security analysis
- ✅ Idea collections that spawn work items

**Do NOT store here:**
- ❌ External references (use external-references/)
- ❌ Active work items (use work/)

**Rule:** If it explains WHY we made a decision, it goes here.

**Idea Collections:** Files containing multiple enhancement ideas or observations that will generate work items. Track created work items in the file, archive when exhausted.

See also: [external-references/README.md](../external-references/README.md) for distinction.
