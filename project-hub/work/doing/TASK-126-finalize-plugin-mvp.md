# TASK-126: Finalize framework-light Plugin MVP for Submission

**Type:** TASK
**Status:** Doing (Implementation complete, final testing pending)
**Created:** 2026-02-12
**Updated:** 2026-02-13
**Related:** FEAT-118 (scope refinement)

---

## Objective

Reduce plugin scope to a focused MVP with 3 core commands (help, new, move) by removing session-history and next-id commands before marketplace submission.

## Context

After prototyping 5 commands, product review identified:
- **session-history**: Documentation feature, not core workflow → Defer to full framework plugin
- **next-id**: Implementation detail leaking into UI → Integrate into `new` command

**MVP Value Proposition:**
"Start using the SpearIT framework workflow in minutes. Create and organize work items right from Claude."

## Scope

### 1. Preserve Removed Features ✅ COMPLETE

- [x] Copy `commands/session-history.md` to safe location
  - ✅ **Option B chosen:** `plugins/spearit-framework/commands/` (future full framework plugin)
- [x] Copy session history template to same location
  - ✅ Created `plugins/spearit-framework/templates/session-history-template.md`
- [x] Document location in FEAT-118 for future reference
  - ✅ README.md created in `plugins/spearit-framework/` documenting preserved files

### 2. Integrate next-id into new Command ✅ COMPLETE

- [x] Update `commands/new.md` to auto-assign next available ID
  - ✅ Replaced summary reference with full detailed instructions from `next-id.md`
  - ✅ Integrated AI-driven scanning logic (Glob tool, regex parsing, max ID + 1)
  - ✅ Added comprehensive edge case handling
  - ✅ Added performance requirements (explicit instructions to NOT use Task agents)
- [x] Test `new` command generates correct sequential IDs (CLI tested)
- [x] Verify behavior with empty work directory (logic included in command)
- [x] Verify behavior with gaps in ID sequence (uses max + 1 approach)

**Implementation:** AI-driven scanning (Glob tool), no bash scripts, performance-optimized.

### 3. Remove Command Files ✅ COMPLETE

- [x] Delete `commands/next-id.md` (preserved in git history and full framework plugin)
- [x] Delete `commands/session-history.md` (preserved in git history and full framework plugin)
- [x] Remove associated templates: `templates/session-history-template.md` (preserved in full framework plugin)

### 4. Update Plugin Metadata ✅ COMPLETE

- [x] **plugin.json** (note: it's plugin.json, not package.json for Claude plugins)
  - ✅ Version updated: `1.0.0` → `1.0.0-dev1` (development testing)
  - ✅ Commands auto-discovered (no manual array needed)
  - ✅ Description accurate
- [x] **README.md**
  - ✅ Changed "5 Core Commands" → "3 Core Commands"
  - ✅ Updated all command references throughout
  - ✅ Updated feature descriptions
  - ✅ Updated usage examples

### 5. Update Documentation ✅ COMPLETE

- [x] **help.md** - Updated to list only 3 commands (help, new, move)
- [x] **CHANGELOG.md** - Created with v1.0.0 release documentation
  - ✅ "Focused MVP on core workflow commands"
  - ✅ "Deferred session-history to full framework plugin"
  - ✅ "Integrated ID assignment into new command"
  - ✅ Added rationale and design decisions
- [x] **Skills documentation** - No changes needed (skills remain unchanged)

### 6. Build & Distribution ✅ COMPLETE

- [x] Run `Build-Plugin.ps1` to regenerate distribution
  - ✅ Built with `-AllowPrerelease` flag (development version)
- [x] Verify `distrib/plugin-light/spearit-framework-light-v1.0.0.zip` updated
  - ✅ New size: 22.46 KB (reduced from 25.45 KB - 12% smaller)
  - ✅ Contents: 3 commands, 3 skills, README, CHANGELOG, plugin.json
- [x] Update local marketplace: `Publish-ToLocalMarketplace.ps1 -Build`
  - ✅ Marketplace updated with version 1.0.0-dev1

### 7. Testing 🔄 IN PROGRESS

**CLI Testing:** ✅ COMPLETE (2026-02-12 evening)
- [x] **Command availability**
  - ✅ `/spearit-framework-light:help` shows only 3 commands
  - ✅ Removed commands (session-history, next-id) not available
  - ✅ Help command shows correct content
- [x] Version verification
  - ✅ Plugin shows version 1.0.0-dev1
  - ✅ Correct plugin listed in CLI

**VSCode Testing:** ⏳ PENDING (requires VSCode restart)
- [ ] **Command availability in VSCode**
  - `/spearit-framework-light:help` shows only 3 commands
  - `/spearit-framework-light:session-history` returns "command not found"
  - `/spearit-framework-light:next-id` returns "command not found"
- [ ] **new command**
  - Creates work item with auto-assigned ID
  - Handles first work item (ID 001)
  - Handles gaps in sequence
  - ID increments correctly
- [ ] **Integration test**
  - Create work item → verify in backlog
  - Move work item → verify in new location
  - Help → verify clean output

**Note:** Plugin commands use `/spearit-framework-light:*` namespace. Local framework commands (if installed) use `/fw-*` prefix.

### 8. Plugin Installation Test ⏳ PENDING

- [ ] Uninstall current plugin (if installed)
- [ ] Clean install from local marketplace
- [ ] Verify only 3 commands appear in plugin help
- [ ] Execute each command to verify functionality

**Note:** Clean install recommended before final testing to verify cache update workflow.

### 9. Update Related Work Items ✅ COMPLETE

- [x] Update FEAT-118 status note:
  - ✅ Added scope change section at top of work item
  - ✅ Status: "⏸️ ON HOLD - Scope refinement in progress"
  - ✅ Blocked By: TASK-126
  - ✅ Documented rationale and timeline impact
- [x] No issues to close in FEAT-118 (tracking continued in TASK-126)

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Plugin contains exactly 3 commands: help, new, move ✅
- [x] `new` command automatically assigns sequential IDs ✅ (logic integrated, testing pending)
- [x] All documentation reflects 3-command scope ✅
- [x] Plugin builds and installs cleanly ✅ (CLI verified, VSCode pending restart)
- [ ] All 3 commands tested and working ⏳ (CLI complete, VSCode pending)
- [x] Removed features preserved for future use ✅ (plugins/spearit-framework/)
- [x] CHANGELOG documents rationale for changes ✅

---

## Decision Record

**Why remove session-history?**
- Documentation feature, not core workflow
- More complex, less frequently used
- Better served in full framework plugin

**Why remove next-id?**
- Implementation detail, not user concern
- `new` command should handle ID assignment internally
- Reduces cognitive load and command bloat

**MVP focuses on:**
- Discovery (help)
- Creation (new with auto-ID)
- Organization (move)

---

## Next Steps After Completion

1. Final submission review (FEAT-118 or new work item)
2. Marketplace submission
3. Plan full framework plugin (includes session-history)
