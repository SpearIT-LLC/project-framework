## Phase Overview

| Phase | Description | Depends On | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Foundation | Both plugins production-ready, marketplace submissions made | — | In Progress |
| 2. Project Guidance MVP | `/swarm` ships in Plugin Full; dogfooding validates output quality | Phase 1 | In Progress |
| 3. Marketplace Launch | Both plugins live in Anthropic marketplace | Phases 1 & 2 | Pending |
| 4. Developer Intelligence | Code-level AI guidance (code review, architecture, feasibility) | Phase 3 + user feedback | Pending |
| 5. Growth & Feedback | Respond to real adoption; refine based on marketplace usage patterns | Phase 3 | Pending |

## Phase Details

### Phase 1: Foundation

**Goal:** Both plugins are production-ready and submitted to the Anthropic marketplace.

**Key work:**
- Plugin Light final validation and packaging
- Plugin Full v1.0 packaging
- Marketplace submission preparation (listing copy, metadata, requirements)

**Risks:** Marketplace submission requirements not fully known; timeline may slip independent of readiness.

---

### Phase 2: Project Guidance MVP

**Goal:** `/swarm` ships in Plugin Full and produces quality output, validated by internal dogfooding on a real SpearIT project.

**Key work:**
- `/swarm` two-phase kick-off implementation complete
- Project brief, project outline, and meeting notes written correctly to file
- Starter backlog output to chat
- Internal dogfooding: run full workflow on a SpearIT project end-to-end
- Onboarding documentation for Plugin Full

**Risks:** First real-world use may surface edge cases not caught in development; `/fw-roadmap` does not yet read project outline as input (known limitation).

---

### Phase 3: Marketplace Launch

**Goal:** Both plugins publicly available in the Anthropic marketplace; a user can install Plugin Full and run `/swarm` in a single session.

**Key work:**
- Marketplace listing finalized and approved
- Launch validation (install → `/swarm` → brief → roadmap end-to-end)
- Onboarding documentation published

**Risks:** External user feedback may require rapid iteration; support load and edge cases are unknown until real users arrive.

---

### Phase 4: Developer Intelligence

**Goal:** AI expert perspectives at the code level — context-aware code reviews, architecture challenges, and technical feasibility assessment using project context established by Project Guidance.

**Key work:** To be defined after Phase 3 completes and user feedback is collected.

**Risks:** Scope not yet defined; depends on what the current Planning Increment (PI) teaches us about user needs and adoption patterns.

---

### Phase 5: Growth & Feedback

**Goal:** Respond to real adoption — refine based on marketplace usage, address gaps surfaced by actual usage patterns, and assess small team viability.

**Key work:** Determined by marketplace feedback and adoption data.

**Risks:** Unknown until real users arrive; may require reprioritization of themes.
