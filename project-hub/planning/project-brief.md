# Project Brief: SpearIT Project Framework

## What We're Building

The SpearIT Project Framework is an AI-guided workflow system for solo developers, Individual Contributors (ICs), and embedded consultants. It delivers professional project practices — structured kick-offs, Kanban workflow, reporting artifacts, and expert-team scrutiny — through Claude Code, with no external tools required.

## Who It's For

Solo developers and consultants who work without an expert team around them. This includes contractors embedded in larger organizations who need to report progress upward, and Individual Contributors (ICs) who want the discipline of a senior team without the overhead of one.

**Primary:** Solo developers and ICs — including consultants embedded in client organizations
**Secondary:** Small teams up to ~5 people

## Why It Matters

Solo developers default to improvised process when there's no team to enforce standards. SpearIT gives them what well-resourced teams take for granted: a Product Owner who challenges scope, an Architect who thinks in systems, a Senior Dev who flags complexity early. The framework becomes the foundation other projects build on — dogfooded first, adopted second.

The framework also serves as a platform: SpearIT internal projects use it directly, and future projects will build on it as a proven foundation.

## MVP Definition

**One product, three delivery tiers:**

| Tier | Contents | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **Plugin Light** | File-based Kanban workflow. Try the methodology in minutes. No project restructuring required. | Shipped (v1.0) |
| **Plugin Full** | Light + Project Guidance. `/swarm` kick-off, project brief, project outline, roadmap integration. The differentiating capability. | PI MVP target |
| **Framework ZIP** | Full plugin capabilities plus local scripting for performance, complete documentation suite, and power-user automation. | Shipped (v5.x) |

**MVP for Plugin Full (current Planning Increment (PI)):**
- `/swarm` two-phase kick-off (Discovery + Planning) ships in Plugin Full
- Project brief, project outline, and meeting notes written to file
- Starter backlog output to chat (file creation is future)
- Both plugins available in Anthropic marketplace

**Explicitly out of scope for MVP:**
- Periodic review and retrospective commands
- `/swarm` reading existing artifacts
- Automatic work item file creation from starter backlog
- Code-level AI guidance (Developer Intelligence — next PI)

## Starter Backlog

- Submit Plugin Light v1.0 to Anthropic marketplace
- Submit Plugin Full v1.0 to Anthropic marketplace
- Complete `/swarm` command implementation and testing
- Validate `/fw-roadmap` works in context of a swarm-initiated project
- Dogfood: run `/swarm` on an internal SpearIT project end-to-end
- Write onboarding documentation for Plugin Full
- Define and validate PI MVP completion criteria

## Open Risks & Questions

1. **Marketplace submission process** — timeline and requirements not fully known; could gate both plugin launches
2. **Dogfooding gap** — Plugin Full not yet used on a real project end-to-end; `/swarm` output quality is unvalidated at scale
3. **Brief → roadmap handoff** — `/fw-roadmap` currently does not read the project outline as input; known limitation that may affect reporting coherence until addressed in a future PI
