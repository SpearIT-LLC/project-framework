./framework/thoughts/history/releases/v3.0.0/RELEASE-NOTES.md:This release represents a fundamental restructuring of the project-framework repository into a monorepo architecture. The framework content has been moved into a dedicated `framework/` folder, and a reference implementation (`project-hello-world/`) has been created. The framework now fully dogfoods itself using the Standard Project Structure.

./framework/thoughts/history/sessions/2026-01-02-SESSION-HISTORY.md:**Key Outcome:** Decision to reorganize framework structure with framework/ and project-hello-world/ as separate top-level folders, implementing "Framework IS a Project" model.

./framework/thoughts/history/sessions/2026-01-11-SESSION-HISTORY.md:Completed FEAT-019 (Pre-Release Checklist Template) and FEAT-039 (Verify project-hello-world Compliance). FEAT-019 moved pre-release checklist from backlog to production template. FEAT-039 performed comprehensive validation of project-hello-world against PROJECT-STRUCTURE-STANDARD.md, resulting in 83% compliance with minor issues identified.
./framework/thoughts/history/sessions/2026-01-11-SESSION-HISTORY.md:### FEAT-039: Verify project-hello-world Compliance
./framework/thoughts/history/sessions/2026-01-11-SESSION-HISTORY.md:**Problem:** project-hello-world created in FEAT-026 as Standard Framework reference, but compliance status unknown. Needed validation before FEAT-025 could determine whether to use it for Standard level validation.

./framework/thoughts/history/sessions/2026-01-11-SESSION-HISTORY.md:Completed two work items successfully. FEAT-019 moved pre-release checklist from backlog to production templates. FEAT-039 performed comprehensive validation of project-hello-world, finding 83% compliance with excellent structure/content but lacking workflow demonstration. Validation report provides clear roadmap for improvements and informs FEAT-025 scope.
./framework/thoughts/history/sessions/2026-01-11-SESSION-HISTORY.md:**Key Achievement:** project-hello-world validated as excellent structural reference, with clear path to complete compliance.
./framework/thoughts/history/sessions/2026-01-11-SESSION-HISTORY.md:Identified dogfooding issue where FEAT-039 (project-hello-world validation) was tracked in framework/thoughts/work/ instead of project-hello-world/thoughts/work/. Led to productive discussion about monorepo context switching and extension to FEAT-037 (Project Config File) to address the problem.
./framework/thoughts/history/sessions/2026-01-11-SESSION-HISTORY.md:While working on FEAT-039 (validating project-hello-world), realized we tracked all issues in framework/thoughts/work/, violating dogfooding principle:
./framework/thoughts/history/sessions/2026-01-11-SESSION-HISTORY.md:- FEAT-039 was about validating project-hello-world
./framework/thoughts/history/sessions/2026-01-11-SESSION-HISTORY.md:- This is wrong - project-hello-world issues should be tracked in project-hello-world/thoughts/work/
./framework/thoughts/history/sessions/2026-01-11-SESSION-HISTORY.md:1. **Explicit verbal declaration** - User says "switch to project-hello-world"

./framework/thoughts/history/sessions/2026-01-13-SESSION-HISTORY.md:**Context:** With framework-as-dependency model (DECISION-050), `project-hello-world/` becomes an example, not a peer project.

./framework/thoughts/work/done/FEAT-039-VALIDATION-REPORT.md:project-hello-world demonstrates excellent structural compliance and content quality but has **minor deviations** from the Standard Framework specification.
./framework/thoughts/work/done/FEAT-039-VALIDATION-REPORT.md:**Can project-hello-world serve as Standard validation reference for FEAT-025?**
./framework/thoughts/work/done/FEAT-039-VALIDATION-REPORT.md:- Both `thoughts/reference/` AND `thoughts/external-references/` exist in project-hello-world
./framework/thoughts/work/done/FEAT-039-VALIDATION-REPORT.md:- project-hello-world has BOTH `thoughts/reference/` AND `thoughts/external-references/`
./framework/thoughts/work/done/FEAT-039-VALIDATION-REPORT.md:### Question: Can project-hello-world serve as Standard level validation reference?
./framework/thoughts/work/done/FEAT-039-VALIDATION-REPORT.md:1. **Use project-hello-world for Structure Validation** ✅
./framework/thoughts/work/done/FEAT-039-VALIDATION-REPORT.md:   - FEAT-025 should add sample work items to project-hello-world OR
./framework/thoughts/work/done/FEAT-039-VALIDATION-REPORT.md:project-hello-world is **structurally excellent** but **functionally incomplete** as a reference implementation. It validates **structure** but not **workflow**.
./framework/thoughts/work/done/FEAT-039-VALIDATION-REPORT.md:- ✅ Can use project-hello-world for Standard structure validation
./framework/thoughts/work/done/FEAT-039-VALIDATION-REPORT.md:- ⚠️ FEAT-025 should enhance project-hello-world OR create separate workflow examples
./framework/thoughts/work/done/FEAT-039-VALIDATION-REPORT.md:**Current:** Missing from project-hello-world version
./framework/thoughts/work/done/FEAT-039-VALIDATION-REPORT.md:2. Use project-hello-world for structure validation
./framework/thoughts/work/done/FEAT-039-VALIDATION-REPORT.md:3. Create work item for adding workflow examples to project-hello-world
./framework/thoughts/work/done/FEAT-039-VALIDATION-REPORT.md:project-hello-world is an **excellent structural reference** with **high-quality content** but lacks **workflow demonstration**. It validates that the Standard Framework structure is achievable and well-organized, but does not demonstrate the framework in active use.
./framework/thoughts/work/done/FEAT-039-VALIDATION-REPORT.md:**Key Insight:** A reference implementation should show both **structure** and **usage**. project-hello-world currently shows only structure.
./framework/thoughts/work/done/FEAT-039-VALIDATION-REPORT.md:**Recommendation:** Enhance project-hello-world with minimal workflow examples (2-3 work items, 1 ADR, 1 session file) to make it a complete reference implementation.
./framework/thoughts/work/done/FEAT-039-VALIDATION-REPORT.md:**For FEAT-025:** Use project-hello-world for structure validation, but create or enhance examples for workflow validation.

./framework/thoughts/work/done/FEAT-039-verify-hello-world-compliance.md:During FEAT-025 alignment analysis, we realized project-hello-world exists but its compliance status is unknown. Before planning FEAT-025 scope, we need to know what project-hello-world actually provides.
